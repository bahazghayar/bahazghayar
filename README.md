## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Aspiring Data Analyst with experience as a Customer Service Associate at Amazon and a background in mechanical engineering. My professional journey has strengthened my problem-solving, communication, and customer-centric skills, which I am now combining with technical expertise in data analysis.

I have built hands-on experience with Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau, working on projects in exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and dashboard creation. I am passionate about using data to uncover insights that improve decision-making, efficiency, and customer experience.

Currently, I am focused on transitioning into a full-time data analytics or business intelligence role, where I can leverage both my customer-facing experience and analytical skills to deliver impact.
